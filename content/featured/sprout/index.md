Sprout.ai is a VC backed insurance technology startup focusing on AI powered claims automation and fraud detection for insurance providers. We implemented a probabilistic generative model approach that helps them understand what types of documents are contained within a dataset. The output is a grouping of the documents based on their similarity.
