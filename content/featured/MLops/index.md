Help transition data science experimentation into a production environment. We are helping our clients create and manage the production ML (or deep learning) lifecycle. We are applying the entire lifecycle - from integrating with model generation (software development lifecycle, continuous integration/continuous delivery), orchestration, and deployment, to health, diagnostics, governance, and business metrics.
