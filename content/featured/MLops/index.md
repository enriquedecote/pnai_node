Bit.bio is a synthetic biology company providing human cells for research, drug discovery and cell therapy. We designed and implemented a data experimentation framework into a production environment. This framework is helping bit.bio create and manage their production ML (or deep learning) lifecycle, which includes integrating with model generation (software development lifecycle, continuous integration/continuous delivery), orchestration, and deployment, to health, diagnostics, governance, and business metrics.
