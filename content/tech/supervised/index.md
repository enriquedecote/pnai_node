Supervised learning is the task of inferring a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. We help companies experiment, prototype and deploy supervised learning projects that solve business problems. Subspecialties include:
- semi-supervised learning (learn with small number of labeled data)
- transfer learning (learn a function even when you don't have labeled data)
- active learning (understand when to ask for new labeled data)
- ensembles (understand how to mix multiple learners)
