We focus on how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximise the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning. 

**Subspecialties include:**
- Exploration/exploitation (the arm bandit setup)
- Multiagent learning
