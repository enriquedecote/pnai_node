This type of learning form a family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks that focus on representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Applications include computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.
