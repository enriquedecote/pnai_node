This is an advanced technique used in natural language processing, which works by injecting information about relevant concept IDs in the prompt to identify the relevant concept IDs.

**Let's break it down.** Imagine you have a vast library filled with books containing information about various topics relevant to your business. Now, Retrieval Augmented Generation is like having a super-smart librarian who not only finds the right books for you but also helps you generate new content based on what's in those books.

This is a very powerful technique that can boost performance of your solution substantially. It requires some ingenious out-of-the-box thinking to squeeze the most out of it. 

*Improvements of up to 80% are common and I recommend starting here rather and moving to fine-tuning directly.*
