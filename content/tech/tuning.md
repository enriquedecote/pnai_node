Fine-tuning is a process used in machine learning, to customize pre-trained LLM models to better fit specific tasks or domains. 

**Let's break it down.**  Imagine your company is like a big ship sailing across the ocean of data. Now, a pre-trained model is like a general-purpose map of the ocean that shows the major currents, islands, and routes. It's useful, but it may not have all the details specific to your journey. 

*Fine-tuning is like adjusting that map to make it more tailored to your company's needs.*

Improvements of up to 100% are not uncommon, but requires more expertise, experience and quick experimentation to get it right.
